<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The initial goal was to achieve full internationalization (i18n) of the frontend UI into Russian, Kazakh, and English. During the session, the user provided specific, iterative feedback, expanding the scope to include:

1.  **Complete base i18n:** Translate all remaining pages that were not touched in the previous session, such as the forgot password page, admin pages, and the new landing page.
2.  **Fix :** The user requested to remove all emojis from titles, translate all static labels, and translate the Back to Dashboard button to Назад (and its equivalents).
3.  **Translate Dynamic Labels:** A follow-up request to translate the data labels (e.g., Имя, Номер телефона) within the Contract Details and Signature Information sections, which were being pulled from database templates and were not static text.
4.  **Translate  (Template Market):** Translate the entire page and redesign the template preview popup. The new popup needed to be better styled and include language-switching buttons (RU/KK/EN) to display the contract content in all three languages.
5.  **Translate :** Translate all labels, instructional texts, and placeholders on the contract creation page.
6.  **Fix Button Style:** The user requested that the Back button on the  should have the same visual style as the one on .

**User's preferred language**: russian

**what currently exists?**
The application is a full-stack contract management system. The agent has now performed a comprehensive internationalization of almost the entire frontend. All major pages, including the dashboard, profile, login, registration, contract creation, contract details, and template market, have been refactored to use . A key implementation detail was creating a dynamic  function on the  to handle translations for data labels that are stored in Russian in the database templates. The UI is almost fully multilingual and functionally stable.

**Last working item**:
-   Last item agent was working: The agent updated the Back button on  to match the style of the button on  for UI consistency, as requested by the user. This involved applying the same CSS classes for a minimal-card neomorphic design.
-   Status: USER VERIFICATION PENDING
-   Agent Testing Done: Y
-   Which testing method agent to use? screenshot tool. The agent can take a screenshot of the  page after logging in and selecting a template to verify the button's appearance.
-   User Testing Done: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   There are no known bugs or issues. The primary focus is on completing the i18n task.

**In progress Task List**:
-   **Task 1: Complete Full UI Internationalization (P0)**
    -   **Where to resume:** The vast majority of the UI has been translated. However, the  file was only partially translated due to its large size (1700+ lines) and complexity. The final step is to perform a comprehensive review of the entire application to catch any remaining hardcoded strings and to finish the translation of .
    -   **What will be achieved with this?** A fully and professionally translated user interface, fulfilling the user's core requirement for the project.
    -   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend
    -   **Blocked on something:** No

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
-   **Future Tasks:**
    -   **Add Watermark to PDF (P1):** A previously user-approved suggestion to add a watermark to generated PDFs.
    -   **Contract Constructor UI (P2):** A long-term vision for a dynamic template builder in the admin panel to avoid hard-coded template logic.
    -   **Detailed Audit Trail (P2):** Implement a more detailed, user-facing log of all actions performed on a contract.
    -   **Version History (P2):** Allow users to view the history of changes made to a contract.

**Completed work in this session**
-   **Full i18n of Core Pages:** Translated , , , , , , and .
-   **Fixed :** Corrected remaining hardcoded strings.
-   **Finalized :** Translated all remaining hardcoded strings, including the password change section.
-   **Overhauled :** Removed all emojis, translated all static text, and implemented a  function to dynamically translate field labels (e.g., Имя, Почта) coming from the database.
-   **Revamped  (Template Market):** Translated the entire page and redesigned the template preview modal to include language-switching tabs (RU/KK/EN) for viewing multilingual contract content.
-   **Completed :** Translated all static text, placeholders, and instructional messages. Also updated the Back button style for UI consistency.
-   **Expanded :** Massively updated the central translation file with hundreds of new keys for Russian, Kazakh, and English to support the newly translated pages and components.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
-   **Issue 1: Incomplete Translation of **
    -   **Debug checklist:** The agent identified this file as being over 1700 lines long and complex. A full translation was deferred to save time. The next agent should use  on this file, add the necessary keys to , and replace the hardcoded strings with  calls.
    -   **Why to solve this issue and what will be achieved with this?** To complete the full UI internationalization task as requested by the user.
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix:** Frontend
    -   **Is recurring issue?** N

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
-   None.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Frontend:** React, , .
-   **Internationalization (i18n):** Heavy use of  with the  hook. A significant pattern was introduced in  to translate dynamic data labels fetched from the backend by creating a mapping function () that uses the translation file as a dictionary.
-   **Backend:** FastAPI, MongoDB ().
-   **PDF Generation:** .

**key DB schema**
-   ****: 
-   ****: 
-   ****: 

**changes in tech stack**
-   None.

**All files of reference**
-   ****: The single source of truth for all UI text. Was massively expanded in this session and must be updated for any further translations.
-   ****: Key file demonstrating the pattern for translating dynamic labels from database content via the  function.
-   ****: Contains the logic for the redesigned template preview modal with language switching.
-   ****: Fully translated page for creating new contracts.
-   ****: The largest remaining file with significant hardcoded Russian text.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   : This file is over 1700 lines long and contains complex, stateful logic. Its translation was started but not completed. It could benefit from being broken down into smaller components.

**key api endpoints**
-   No new endpoints were created. The work was entirely on the frontend.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **Main Goal:** The user's primary objective is a 100% translated UI. Your main task is to verify this and complete any missing pieces, with  being the most significant one.
-   **Dynamic Label Translation Pattern:** When you encounter labels that are not static (e.g., placeholder names in the contract details), refer to the  function in . This pattern uses the  function with a constructed key (e.g., ) to look up translations for dynamic data.
-   **User Feedback Loop:** The user is very engaged and provides iterative feedback with screenshots. Expect to work on one page, get feedback, and then move to the next. Always confirm completion with screenshots.

**documents and test reports created in this job**
-    was updated.

10. **User:** (from prev fork) everything is great (after PDF design update) (Status: **Completed**)

**Project Health Check:**

-   **Mocked:** No mocked components.
-   The application is stable, with the frontend now almost fully internationalized.

**3rd Party Integrations**
-   : Used for frontend UI internationalization.
-   : Used for backend PDF generation.
-   : Used for generating QR codes within the PDF.

**Testing status**
-   **Testing agent used after significant changes:** YES, the frontend testing agent was used to find remaining hardcoded strings, which were subsequently fixed.
-   **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop:** NO
-   **Test files created:** None.

**What agent forgot to execute**
-   The agent pragmatically chose to only partially translate  due to its significant size and complexity, to make progress on other user requests. This was a conscious decision, not an oversight, but the task remains incomplete.</analysis>
