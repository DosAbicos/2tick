<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user's initial goal was to stabilize their production SaaS application on a VPS, complete a FreedomPay integration, and finish several feature refinements.

In this session, the user confirmed their server is now stable and directed the agent to focus on new feature work. The agent's work included:
1.  **Internationalization (i18n):** Completing the translation of all legal pages, tariff descriptions, and a new FAQ section into Russian, Kazakh, and English. The user explicitly requested to *not* translate the admin panel.
2.  **SEO Enhancements:** Creating  and , adding a Yandex verification file, and significantly expanding the SEO keywords in .
3.  **Legal Compliance:** Adding a mandatory accept terms checkbox to the user registration flow, which is now fully translated and prevents registration without consent.
4.  **Asset Creation:** Generating a square PNG avatar for the user's Telegram bot.
5.  **Contract Template Generation:** Creating three comprehensive, tri-lingual contract templates (monthly rental, daily rental, service agreement). These templates were legally strengthened with clauses specific to Kazakhstan's laws on Simple Electronic Signatures (ПЭП) and delivered to the user in a single  file.

**User's preferred language**: russian

**what currently exists?**
The application is a full-stack SaaS platform for digital contract signing (React + FastAPI + MongoDB). The user reports that the production deployment is now stable.

The codebase now includes:
-   Completed internationalization for all user-facing pages (excluding the admin panel) for RU/KK/EN.
-   Enhanced SEO with , , expanded keywords, and a Yandex verification file in .
-   A legally required accept terms checkbox on the registration page.
-   A new square PNG avatar for the Telegram bot in .
-   A final Word document () containing three legally-sound, tri-lingual contract templates. These templates exist only as a file and are **not** in the database.

**Last working item**:
-   Last item agent was working: The agent created and delivered the final, legally correct version of the contract templates (). This version was updated to use the correct legal term ПЭП (Simple Electronic Signature) instead of ЭЦП, as requested by the user.
-   Status: COMPLETED
-   Agent Testing Done: N/A
-   Which testing method agent to use? N/A
-   User Testing Done: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
There are no pending technical issues. The primary blocker from the previous session (VPS instability) was reported as resolved by the user.

**In progress Task List**:
There are no tasks currently in progress.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
-   **Upcoming Tasks:**
    -   **(P0) Implement Contract Templates in Application:** The user has received the contract templates as a text file. The next logical step is to integrate them into the application, allowing users to select and populate these templates when creating a new contract. This should be proposed to the user first.
-   **Future Tasks:**
    -   (P1) Add Watermark to generated PDF contracts.
    -   (P2) Implement a Mock or Test mode for the payment flow UI.
    -   (P2) Develop a user-facing Contract Constructor UI.
    -   (P2) Implement a detailed Audit Trail for contract actions.
    -   (P2) Add Version History for contracts.
    -   (P2) Re-implement the auto-renewal toggle for subscriptions.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
-   **Issue 1: Incomplete Translation of **
    -   This was intentionally not fixed as the user explicitly said: не нужно админку переводить (no need to translate the admin panel). This should be considered a deprioritized task.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
-   The critical VPS deployment instability was reported as **resolved by the user**. The underlying cause (a fragile manual deployment process) may still exist, but it is not an active issue.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Internationalization:** Extensive use of  ( hook, JSON translation files).
-   **SEO:** Manual creation of , , and editing of meta tags.
-   **Asset Generation:** Using shell commands (, ) to convert between file formats (SVG to PNG, Markdown to DOCX).
-   **Database Interaction:** Using a Python script with  to perform database operations (insert/delete).

**key DB schema**
-   No changes were made to the database schema.

**changes in tech stack**
-   None.

**All files of reference**
-   **Created:**

-   **Updated:**

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   The user's manual deployment workflow remains a potential point of failure. A robust  script, as mentioned in the previous handoff, would be a valuable improvement for long-term stability.

**key api endpoints**
-   No new API endpoints were created.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   You MUST respond in **Russian**.
-   The user's server is reportedly stable. The highest priority has shifted from bug-fixing to new feature development.
-   Do NOT work on translating the admin panel unless the user specifically asks for it.
-   The user has been given contract templates as a  file. The next logical step is to propose integrating these templates into the application itself for users to select. Confirm this plan with the user before starting.
-   The user changed their mind about storing templates in the database. They now have them as a text file. Be prepared for similar changes in direction and always confirm the final approach.

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending HUMAN messages**
1.  **User:** Asks why the term ЭЦП (Digital Signature) was used and confirms it should be ПЭП (Simple Electronic Signature). (Status: **Addressed**, agent corrected the documents).

-   : For payments.
-   : For i18n.
-   : For OTP.
-   : For deployment.

**Testing status**
-   Testing agent used after significant changes: NO
-   Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop: NO
-   Test files created: []
-   Known regressions: None.

**Credentials to test flow:**
-   **FreedomPay Test Credentials:**
    -   **Merchant ID:** 
    -   **Secret Key:** 

**What agent forgot to execute**
-   Nothing was forgotten. The agent correctly followed the user's changing requirements, such as abandoning the database-driven template approach in favor of a simple  file. The admin panel translation was skipped intentionally based on the user's direct instruction.</analysis>
