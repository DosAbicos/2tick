The trajectory chronicles the iterative development and refinement of the Signify KZ (later 2tick.kz) application by an AI engineer. It starts with initial bug fixes and feature enhancements, including contract download logic, UI state persistence, and admin panel usability. The engineer then addresses user feedback, correcting issues related to authentication for downloads, UI overflow, and navigation. A significant portion of the recent work revolves around a comprehensive redesign request, shifting from Signify KZ to 2tick.kz with a Neumorphism-inspired, minimalist aesthetic, and mobile responsiveness. The AI engineer systematically implements these design changes across various frontend components, including the landing page, header, registration, login, and is currently in the process of updating other core pages like Dashboard and Profile, while also managing branding changes and adapting to user feedback on design elements.

The Signify KZ (now 2tick.kz) platform facilitates remote contract signing in Kazakhstan, supporting RU, KZ, EN languages. It allows Creators to generate contracts and Signers to verify identity and sign using MFA. Key features include rich text contract creation, PDF generation with metadata, and an admin panel for user/contract management. The AI engineer was tasked with:
1.  **Contract/Placeholder Logic**: Correct display and replacement of placeholder values, intelligent skipping of tenant input.
2.  **Admin Panel Enhancements**: Real-time system metrics, detailed error logging, user activity logging, admin notifications, user-specific contract display, unified search.
3.  **UI/UX & Stability**: Resolve UI flickering, improve tab order, implement 10-digit user IDs, temporary state saving, email delivery fixes, accurate downloaded content.
4.  **Latest Requests (Redesign & Branding)**:
    *   Implement a dynamic Admin/Back button in the header.
    *   Fix  to persist active tabs/modals in the admin panel but clear search queries on refresh.
    *   Perform a complete UI redesign to a modern, minimalist Neumorphism style with blue/white colors, adaptable for mobile.
    *   Rename all instances of Signify KZ to 2tick.kz across the application.
    *   Initially requested, but then removed: Hummingbird animation for registration.
    *   Adapt all core pages (Login, Profile, Dashboard, Admin) to the new design with mobile responsiveness.
